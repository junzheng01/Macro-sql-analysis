Real GDP (RGDP) and Nominal GDP (NGDP) are both measures of a country's economic output
Nominal GDP uses current prices
Real GDP adjusts for inflation by using constant prices from a base year
- This means that real GDP provides a more accurate picture of economic growth by removing the distortion caused by price changes.
